Excellent and very deep question — this actually sits at the intersection of liquidity risk, market impact modeling, and derivative sensitivity aggregation, and while there’s no single unified “hard-to-replace derivative” framework, several academic and industry frameworks do exactly what you’re describing — they attempt to quantify how much “flow pressure” (measured in delta, DV01, vega, etc.) a market can absorb before prices move non-linearly.

Let me break it down systematically for you 👇

⸻

🧩 1. Conceptual Core — “Hard-to-Replace Derivative”

What you’re intuitively describing has been discussed under names like:
	•	Market Depth vs Position Sensitivity
	•	Liquidity-adjusted Greeks
	•	Implied Market Capacity
	•	Market Impact Elasticity
	•	Hard-to-Replace Trade (HTR) or “Liquidity horizon” concept in FRTB (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book)

In essence:

Hard-to-replace derivative = position size (in sensitivity units) ÷ typical market liquidity (in the same units).

For example:
	•	For interest-rate swaps → compare your DV01 (dollar value of a basis point) exposure vs the average DV01 traded per day in that tenor.
	•	For options → compare your vega (or vanna/volga) vs the average daily vega turnover in that maturity/bucket.

When the ratio is large (say, >5× daily turnover), the trade is “hard to replace”: if you tried to unwind it, the market impact per bp or per vol point would be material.

🧠 2. Theoretical Foundations & Key References

(a) Kyle’s Lambda (1985, “Continuous Auctions and Insider Trading”)
	•	Defines market impact parameter λ = ΔP / Q, i.e. price change per unit of order flow.
	•	Extended versions apply to derivative sensitivities:
\Delta P = \lambda \times \text{sensitivity imbalance (ΔDV01, ΔVega, etc.)}
	•	Empirically, λ scales roughly with 1 / \sqrt{\text{daily volume}}.
https://people.duke.edu/~qc2/BA532/1985%20EMA%20Kyle.pdf
(b) Almgren–Chriss Framework (2000)
	•	Originally for equity execution but extended to fixed-income and derivatives.
	•	Defines temporary and permanent market impact as a function of trading rate q_t:
\text{Impact cost} \propto \eta \cdot q_t + \frac{1}{2}\gamma q_t^2
where η, γ calibrated from volume and volatility.
	•	For derivatives, replace q_t with DV01/day or Vega/day.

(c) FRTB Liquidity Horizon Framework (Basel III)
	•	Each risk factor has a liquidity horizon (LH) (e.g., 10d for USD 10y rates, 20d for credit spread, 60d for equity vol, etc.).
	•	This LH is implicitly a “hard-to-replace” metric: how long it would take to replace or hedge your position under stressed liquidity.
	•	In FRTB IMCC:
IMCC = \sqrt{\sum_{i} \left( \frac{LH_i}{10} \right) \times Var_i}
	•	Derived from historical illiquidity during stress.

(d) Market Impact Scaling Studies
	•	Empirical studies by BIS, ECB, and dealers show:
\text{Impact (bps)} \approx k \cdot \left( \frac{\text{Position Sensitivity}}{\text{Daily Sensitivity Volume}} \right)^{\alpha}
with α typically between 0.4–0.6 (concave response).

⚙️ 3. How Practitioners Implement It

In internal risk systems:
	•	Compute total DV01, vega, etc. per risk factor.
	•	Divide by average daily traded DV01/vega from TRACE, SDR, or broker data.
	•	Produce “liquidity ratio” = sensitivity / daily liquidity.

Example:

Tenor	DV01 Exposure ($mm/bp)	Daily DV01 Traded ($mm/bp)	Ratio	Status
USD 10y swap	500	200	2.5x	moderately illiquid
EUR 30y swap	600	80	7.5x	hard to replace

Then, apply a market-impact elasticity:
\text{Impact (bps)} = c \times \left( \frac{\text{ratio}}{1} \right)^{0.5}
where c calibrated from historical unwind events.

📈 4. Sensitivities as Liquidity Measures

You’re right: in derivatives markets, sensitivities (DV01, Vega, Delta) are the unit of liquidity.
Market participants often quote:
	•	DV01/day: typical notional volume converted to DV01 terms.
	•	Vega/day: same for options.

Liquidity studies sometimes use:
	•	Risk-Weighted Volume (RWV) = ∑ |sensitivity| × market depth factor.
	•	Used by central banks and large dealers (see BIS Liquidity Working Group, 2020–2023).

If you like, I can show you a numerical example in Python or Excel, e.g., how 3× daily vega pressure would move implied vols by ~0.5 vol-points using an empirical elasticity.
