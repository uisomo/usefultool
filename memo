📩 Farewell Email – Draft

Subject: Thank You and Farewell

Dear Team,

As I move on to my next chapter and return to the banking industry as a credit and financing risk manager, I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to all of you.

When I joined, I did not have much experience in this field. However, thanks to the incredible colleagues I’ve met here — from Japan, Hawaii, and all around the world — I had the privilege of learning and growing every single day.

I truly appreciated the environment where I could speak freely, challenge myself, and learn from so many talented experts. Not many workplaces offer the opportunity to build new technologies and innovate together the way we do here. It has been an honor to be part of a team that values both hard work and a healthy work-life balance.

Thank you for your support, your mentorship, and the great memories we shared.
I will carry all of these experiences with me into my future.

I wish you continued success and exciting opportunities ahead.
Please feel free to stay in touch — I would love to cross paths again in the future.

Warmest regards,
[Your Name]
