Recent market turbulence—largely driven by aggressive tariff policies and ensuing economic uncertainty—has put significant pressure on several hedge funds. A number of notable funds have been reported to suffer substantial losses recently:

Prominent Examples of Hedge Fund Losses
	1.	Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Holdings:
Reuters reported that Ackman’s Pershing Square Holdings fund has dropped nearly 14% year‐to‐date. The losses have been attributed to broader global market declines triggered by sweeping tariff announcements from the Trump administration, which have unsettled investors and increased volatility in asset prices.  ￼
	2.	Large Multi-Strategy Hedge Funds:
Multiple reports indicate that well-known multi-strategy funds have also been hit. For example, Bloomberg and Reuters sources noted that funds such as Citadel and Millennium Management experienced losses in March 2025. Citadel’s flagship fund lost approximately 0.5% during the month, while Millennium Management’s main fund dropped about 1.2%. These losses compounded over the quarter, reflecting the heightened volatility in markets and the challenging environment for funds holding large, concentrated equity positions.  ￼  ￼
	3.	Pressure on Funds Using the “Basis Trade” Strategy:
Another area of concern has been for hedge funds that engage in basis trades—strategies that exploit small pricing discrepancies between U.S. Treasury futures and the underlying cash Treasuries. Amid the recent selloffs in the U.S. Treasury market, these funds have faced forced unwinding of leveraged positions due to margin calls, thereby suffering material losses. Various Reuters and Bloomberg articles have highlighted this risk as part of a broader narrative of stressed market conditions.  ￼  ￼
	4.	General Downturn in Global Hedge Fund Performance:
Additional analysis from Morgan Stanley, as cited by Reuters, observed that global hedge funds posted growing losses last week with net leverage dropping to near historical lows. This deleveraging has been partly driven by market participants reducing exposure amid the uncertainty caused by tariff and trade policy fluctuations.  ￼

Contributing Factors
	•	Tariff Policies and Trade Uncertainty:
Aggressive tariff measures announced by President Trump have been a central catalyst, triggering panic selling and volatility not just in equities but also in bonds. This dual stress on both asset classes has placed hedge funds in a difficult position as they adjust their strategies rapidly.
	•	Margin Calls and Forced Liquidations:
As market volatility increases, funds that rely on leverage have found themselves facing margin calls from their prime brokers. This forced deleveraging has occasionally forced the rapid sale of positions, further deepening losses.
	•	Sector-Specific Setbacks:
For some hedge funds, losses have been amplified by concentrated bets in sectors that have been most affected by the economic shock—for example, tech stocks and other high-growth equities.

Conclusion

Overall, while hedge funds are typically built to navigate market volatility, the current combination of aggressive tariff policies, rapid deleveraging, and broader global economic uncertainty has resulted in several high-profile funds suffering significant losses. Notable examples include Ackman’s Pershing Square Holdings and major multi-strategy funds like Citadel and Millennium Management, as well as funds engaging in basis trades that have experienced forced liquidations. These events underscore how quickly market conditions can shift and the challenges even seasoned hedge funds face in turbulent environments.
