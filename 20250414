📈 Market Recap: April 7–11, 2025

U.S. equities rebounded sharply after a tumultuous start to April: ￼
	•	S&P 500: +5.7% ￼
	•	Dow Jones: +5.0% ￼
	•	Nasdaq: +7.3% ￼
	•	Russell 2000: +1.8% ￼

The rally was fueled by President Trump’s 90-day pause on most tariffs, which temporarily eased fears of a global trade war. However, tariffs on Chinese imports were increased to 145%, prompting China to retaliate with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods.  ￼ ￼

Despite the rebound, year-to-date losses remain significant:
	•	S&P 500: −8.8%
	•	Dow Jones: −5.5%
	•	Nasdaq: −13.4%
	•	Russell 2000: −16.6%

Bond markets experienced volatility, with Treasury yields rising amid concerns over inflation and potential foreign divestment from U.S. assets.  ￼ The U.S. dollar weakened, and gold prices reached new highs as investors sought safe-haven assets.  ￼
