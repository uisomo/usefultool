🎯 Slide 1 – Problem Context: Why Hedge-Fund Default Modeling Needs a New Lens

Main Points
	•	Traditional models treat default as solvency failure (corporate-style).
	•	Hedge funds usually default when margin calls cannot be met.
	•	Dealer banks still rely on reduced-form credit curves → conceptual mismatch.
	•	Goal: Connect margin-call mechanics → probability of default → haircut/rating.

Speaker Notes

Reference: Wujiang Lou (2024), “When Margin Call Burns Out Liquidity Buffer”, pp.5–15.
Hedge fund defaults are driven by liquidity, not solvency. Traditional corporate-style default curves fail to capture this dynamic.

⸻

💧 Slide 2 – Core Idea: Liquidity-Buffer Framework

Main Points
	•	Liquidity buffer (B) = cash reserve used to meet margin calls.
	•	When cumulative margin calls exceed B → fund defaults, broker unwinds.
	•	Default probability = chance margin losses exceed buffer within MPR (Margin Period of Risk).
	•	Creates a structural (not reduced-form) model: default arises from the dynamics of the portfolio’s margin losses.

Speaker Notes

Reference: Wujiang Lou (2024), pp.6–7.
This is analogous to a “cash bucket” that empties when the market moves against the fund.

⚙️ Slide 3 – Mapping to Merton Logic

Main Points

Merton Term	Liquidity-Buffer Equivalent	Meaning
Firm assets A	Liquidity buffer B	Cash available for margin calls
Debt D	Stress loss L_{0.999}	Margin call requirement
σₐ	σₕ	Volatility of 10-day margin losses
rT	≈ 0	Drift negligible over 10-day horizon
PD = N(–d₂)	PD = 1 – Φ((B–mh)/σₕ)	Distance-to-default logic identical

	•	Merton: Default = assets < debt.
	•	Liquidity model: Default = buffer < stress loss.
	•	Simplified: drop drift, short horizon (10 days = MPR).
	•	Same geometry, different domain.

Speaker Notes

Reference: Merton (1974) and Lou (2024) §§2–4.
The same “distance-to-default” math applies — just swap assets → cash buffer.

⸻

📊 Slide 4 – From Simulation to Ratings

Main Points
	•	Simulate margin-call losses; count how often loss > buffer → PD curve.
	•	Map PDs to rating buckets using S&P default rate data.
	•	Example mappings:
	•	15% buffer & 16% haircut → BB+ rating.
	•	25% buffer → A– rating.
	•	Provides an internal rating proxy without relying on external credit curves.

Speaker Notes

Reference: Wujiang Lou (2024), Table 1, pp.13–15.
The model builds a lookup: liquidity buffer × haircut ↔ implied credit rating.

⸻

🔍 Slide 5 – Why the Mapping Is Legitimate

Main Points
	1.	Same structural foundation as Merton: both use distance-to-default.
	2.	Only the trigger differs: liquidity failure vs. solvency failure.
	3.	Information alignment: banks know margin portfolio & buffer, but not fund balance sheet.
	4.	Calibrated via observable ratios: IA ↔ stress loss multiplier (α).
	5.	Empirically validated: outputs align with S&P’s 1-year PDs per rating bucket.

Speaker Notes

Reference: Lou (2024), p.18; Merton (1974).
The mapping is mathematically coherent and data-driven, not an assumption leap.

⸻

🧮 Slide 6 – Practical Extensions

Main Points
	•	PD → Haircut: set haircut to achieve target “no-loss probability” over MPR.
	•	Per-broker buffers improve transparency and counterparty risk separation.
	•	Works for P2P lenders, exchanges, CCPs lacking full credit analysis.
	•	Add Wrong-Way Risk: inflate α when portfolio & collateral co-move.

Speaker Notes

Reference: Lou (2024), pp.17–18.
This enables smaller players and clearing houses to assess hedge fund risk independently.

⸻

🧠 Slide 7 – Consensus-Building Logic

Main Points
	•	The model extends, not replaces, structural default theory.
	•	Default = “cash buffer < margin call,” analogous to “assets < debt.”
	•	The time horizon shortens (10-day liquidity window).
	•	Therefore, linking IA ↔ stress loss ↔ buffer ↔ PD is theoretically consistent and operationally transparent.

Speaker Notes

Reference: Lou (2024), §§2–5.
The Merton logic remains intact; only the trigger condition changes to liquidity exhaustion.

Speaker Notes

All equations, tables, and rating mappings trace directly to these three primary sources.
Wujiang Lou (2024) provides the hedge-fund-specific liquidity framework; Merton (1974) provides structural grounding; S&P (2022) provides empirical rating PDs.

✅ Summary of Logical Flow (for presenter)
	1.	Problem: Corporate-style credit models don’t match hedge-fund liquidity defaults.
	2.	Model: Liquidity buffer exhaustion = endogenous default trigger.
	3.	Theory: Direct structural mapping to Merton framework.
	4.	Application: Convert PD → Rating → Haircut.
	5.	Validation: Matches observed rating PDs.
	6.	Outcome: Practical, transparent, consensus-credible Excellent refinement — you’re absolutely right that Slide 3 (“Mapping to Merton Logic”) should go deeper into how the Merton model actually works (asset vs. debt, volatility → probability), then clearly restate how the same mechanism translates to hedge funds.

Below is the expanded, presentation-ready version of that slide, fully grounded in the Liquidity Buffer Burnout paper and Merton (1974).

⚙️ Slide 3 – Mapping to Merton Logic (Expanded)

🧩 A. What the Original Merton Model Does
	•	A firm’s assets follow a stochastic process A_t that fluctuates with market volatility σₐ.
	•	It has debt D, a fixed obligation due at maturity T.
	•	If at T the assets are worth less than the debt (A_T < D), the firm defaults.
	•	Because both assets and debt move stochastically, we can quantify how often that happens in probabilistic terms.
	•	The distance to default is
d_2 = \frac{\ln(A_0 / D) + (r - 0.5σ_A^2) T}{σ_A √T}
and
PD = N(-d_2).
	•	In plain English: the closer and more volatile the firm’s assets are relative to its debt, the higher the chance the debt will overtake the assets before maturity.

⸻

💧 B. Why This Applies to Hedge Funds

As the Liquidity Buffer Burnout paper notes, a depleting margin account is mathematically equivalent to an asset process hitting a debt barrier — a first-passage (default) model in the sense of Merton (1974) and Black & Cox (1976) ￼.

Merton Model	Hedge-Fund Liquidity Model	Intuition
Assets Aₜ	Liquidity buffer B(t)	Cash available to meet margin calls
Debt D	Cumulative margin calls C(t)	Cash demanded by brokers
Default event: Aₜ < D	Default event: B(t) depleted → C(t) > B(0)	Buffer runs out
Volatility σₐ	Volatility of loss σₕ (from stress or IA ratio)	Market uncertainty drives both
Horizon T (1 yr)	MPR h (≈ 10 days)	Reaction time window

Thus, the hedge-fund default probability can be written analogously as
PD_h = 1 - Φ\!\left(\frac{B - m h}{σ_h}\right),
the short-horizon version of Merton’s PD = N(-d_2).

⸻

🧠 C. Conceptual Restatement
	•	Corporate default = “assets fall below debt” (solvency failure).
	•	Hedge-fund default = “cash buffer falls below margin calls” (liquidity failure).
	•	In both cases, we observe how often a volatile process (asset value or margin loss) crosses a barrier.
	•	Because this frequency can be calculated from volatility and distance, we get a quantified default probability that naturally links to ratings and haircuts.

Speaker Notes

References: Merton (1974) Journal of Finance; Wujiang Lou (2024) Liquidity Buffer Burnout, pp. 6–8 and Eq. (4) ￼.
The paper explicitly equates margin-account depletion with the first-passage problem in structural credit theory, so the logic is not a leap but a short-horizon specialization of Merton’s framework.
