There are reasons to be cautious about potential defaults—and their domino‐like spillovers—in all three markets, though the nature and immediacy of the risks differ.

Below is a breakdown by region:

⸻

United States

• Rising Default Pressure in the Corporate Debt Market:
In recent years, the U.S. corporate debt landscape has become increasingly fragile. Leveraged loans (loans to companies with large existing debt or weaker credit profiles) have seen their default rate rise—the latest figures suggest defaults on leveraged loans have reached levels not seen in four years ( ￼). In addition, several high-profile U.S. retailers and companies (for example, J.Crew, Neiman Marcus, J.C. Penney, and even debt-fraught companies in the oil sector) have already filed for bankruptcy during periods of stress. While many of these defaults have been sector‐specific rather than systemic, they underscore how a further deterioration in economic conditions (for instance, amid a deeper recession) could precipitate additional defaults. Such losses could then spread through exposures held by banks, mutual funds, and other fixed‑income investors.

• Potential Domino Effect:
If defaults accelerate—especially among companies reliant on short-term funding or with high debt loads—it could lead investors to reassess the quality of many corporate bonds. This may force an unwinding of positions as investors try to sell off “risky” debt in a stressed market, potentially reducing liquidity and raising borrowing costs for a broader swath of companies. Although so far the contagion has been contained within certain distressed sectors, the risk is that a sharp economic downturn might change that balance.

Japan

• Stress on Financial Institutions and Credit Markets:
Japanese banks have recently posted significant losses and sharp weekly declines amid global trade tensions and a slowing domestic recovery. For example, major financial institutions such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, and Sumitomo Mitsui have experienced historical levels of weekly declines (). These developments have raised concerns over the resilience of Japan’s financial sector—especially given that a substantial part of bank lending is to companies whose profitability has been eroded by weak growth conditions.

• Default Risk and the Domino Potential:
While no single Japanese non‐financial company has been widely identified as teetering on the brink of default at the same scale as some in China, the stress in the banking sector is a cause for concern. A further deterioration in economic conditions or a sudden spike in defaults among corporate borrowers (should the economic recovery falter) could strain banks’ balance sheets. Because banks are the linchpin of credit circulation in Japan, deteriorating asset quality could in turn make banks more cautious with lending, potentially setting off a wider credit contraction.

China

• Systemic Concerns in the Property Sector:
The most acute default risks—and the associated domino effect—are currently in China’s property sector. China Evergrande Group, once one of the country’s largest property developers, has already defaulted and is now in a court-ordered liquidation process ( ￼). Other property developers such as Country Garden have been under significant liquidity pressure and are highly leveraged. For instance, Country Garden’s debt exposure and the postponement of its debt restructuring hearings ( ￼,  ￼) signal that a default among large developers remains an imminent risk.

• Potential for a Domino Impact:
The Chinese property sector is deeply intertwined with regional banks, suppliers, and local government finances. If major property firms default, the knock-on effects could – in principle – spread throughout the financial system. A credit crunch in the property market might lead to reduced lending, halted projects, and further job losses, thereby affecting consumer spending and regional economic growth. Because many banks hold both direct exposures to real‑estate companies and collateralized loans secured on property, a cascade of defaults could have global repercussions through cross‑border financial linkages.

Summary
	•	In the U.S., while isolated defaults (especially in sectors like retail and energy) have already occurred, the broader corporate debt market—characterized by rising default risks on leveraged loans—remains vulnerable. A pronounced downturn could trigger further defaults and a tightening of credit conditions, thereby creating a domino effect across financial markets.
	•	In Japan, the most immediate concerns center on banking sector weakness rather than a specific corporate default. Banks’ exposures to deteriorating corporate balance sheets and the sensitivity of the credit market to slow growth could, if worsened, lead to a chain reaction affecting broader economic activity.
	•	In China, the property sector is the epicenter of default risk. With giants like Evergrande already defaulting and others such as Country Garden facing severe liquidity issues, the risk of a domino effect is more pronounced. The interconnectedness of property firms with regional banks and local governments amplifies the potential for systemic contagion.

Investors and policymakers alike are watching these developments closely. While economic conditions, regulatory responses, and market dynamics (such as the availability of liquidity) can mitigate or exacerbate these risks, the potential for domino-like contagion exists—especially in the Chinese market, where any additional defaults could reverberate widely.

Each region’s risk profile is dynamic and highly contingent on macroeconomic factors—including interest rates, global trade conditions, and growth prospects—so while current indicators are worrying in some areas, the situation will continue to evolve.
