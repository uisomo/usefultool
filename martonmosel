Excellent — now let’s connect your simplified “liquidity-bucket” model to the traditional Merton structural model so you see which parts are equivalent, which are simplified, and what’s intentionally dropped.

⸻

🧩 1️⃣ The Traditional Merton Model (full form)

In Merton’s world:
\begin{aligned}
A_t &= \text{asset value of the firm at time } t, \\
D &= \text{debt due at time } T, \\
r_f &= \text{risk-free rate}, \\
\sigma_A &= \text{volatility of asset value.}
\end{aligned}

Default occurs if the firm’s asset value falls below its debt at maturity T:
PD = N(-d_2), \quad \text{where} \quad d_2 = \frac{\ln(A_0 / D) + (r_f - 0.5\sigma_A^2)T}{\sigma_A \sqrt{T}}.

🪣 2️⃣ What your liquidity-buffer model does

Your model swaps “firm value vs. debt” for a cash buffer vs. stress loss comparison:

Merton term	Your equivalent	Intuitive meaning
A_0 = current asset value	B = cash buffer	What you can use to pay margin
D = debt due at time T	L_{0.999} = stress loss (worst 10-day margin call)	What you might have to pay
\sigma_A = asset volatility	\sigma_h = volatility of 10-day loss	Size of daily market shocks
r_f T term	≈ 0	Cash buffer isn’t earning or growing materially
T	h = MPR in days	Horizon until liquidation
PD = N(-d_2)	PD_h = 1 - \Phi\!\left(\dfrac{B - m h}{\sigma_h}\right)	Probability buffer < loss

So the mathematical skeleton is identical:
	•	A “distance-to-default” = (buffer − expected loss) / volatility.
	•	PD = N(-DD).

⚙️ 3️⃣ Which parts are simplified or dropped

Feature	Merton version	Liquidity-bucket version	Simplification
Time horizon T	Continuous, can be 1 year	Fixed short MPR (e.g. 10 days)	Shortens horizon to match margin cycle
Interest rate r_f	Appears in drift	Ignored	Buffer earns negligible return in 10 days
Continuous asset diffusion	log-normal A_t	direct loss distribution on margin calls	Focuses only on tail P&L, skips firm balance-sheet dynamics
Debt amortization	single payment at T	single margin call at 99.9 % loss	Same binary default condition
Asset correlation structure	explicit in σₐ	absorbed in stress multiplier α	Uses empirical stress instead of modeled σ
Equity market value link	E = f(A_0, D)	not used	No need for market-implied equity vol
Calibration	implied from market spreads	empirical IA ↔ stress ratios	Quicker, internal calibration
Risk horizon	long-term solvency	short-term liquidity	Structural idea, liquidity lens


⸻

🧠 4️⃣ Conceptual Summary
	•	Merton asks: “Will the company’s total value cover its debt at year-end?”
	•	You ask: “Will the fund’s cash buffer cover the margin call in the next 10 days?”

Same geometry, different time scale and variable names.

🧮 5️⃣ The link in one line

If we rewrite Merton’s d_2 ignoring drift and risk-free rate:
d_2 \approx \frac{\ln(A_0 / D)}{\sigma_A \sqrt{T}}
and compare to your simplified version:
\text{DD}h = \frac{B}{L{0.999}/z_{0.999}}
they are structurally identical — both measure how many “sigmas” away the default barrier is.

⸻

✅ In plain English

You’ve shrunk Merton’s 1-year solvency world into a 10-day liquidity world.
The “assets vs. debt” idea becomes “cash vs. margin call,” and you drop drift, interest, and balance-sheet growth terms.
What remains is the pure distance-to-default logic that maps straight to a default probability.

Would you like me to show how to write both formulas side-by-side in Excel (so you can verify that your r-based PD and a stripped-down Merton PD produce the same numeric curve)?
